## What is LangChain?
(from [LangChain Github](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain)) <br>
LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models.<br>
It enables applications that:<br>
**Are context-aware**: connect a language model to sources of context (prompt instructions, few shot examples, content to ground its response in, etc.)<br>
**Reason**: rely on a language model to reason (about how to answer based on provided context, what actions to take, etc.)<br>
<br>
