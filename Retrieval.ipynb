(사진=CBS)힌튼 교수는 챗봇이 사람보다 매개변수는 적지만, 더 복잡한 일을 사람보다 더 잘 이해, 처리할 수 있다는 입장이다. 그는 \"일반적으로 사람은 복잡한 일을 처리할 경우, 이를 충분히 숙지하고 이해해야 한다\"고 말했다. 사람은 뇌에서 무슨 일이 일어나는지, 신경망이 이를 어떻게 받아들이는지 인지하지 못하기 때문이다.그는 \"반면 AI는 말 그대로 기계\"라며 \"매개변수 간 연결성과 정보 처리 과정을 사람보다 더 잘 안다\"고 설명했다. 힌튼 교수 설명에 따르면, AI가 난이도 높은 업무를 수행할 경우 학습 알고리즘을 통해 데이터와 상호작용하면서 복잡한 신경망을 새로 만든다. 해당 신경망을 통해 복잡한 업무를 즉각적으로 받아들이고 처리할 수 있다.제프리 힌튼 교수는 \"AI의 이런 능력이 더 발달한다면, 향후 자율적으로 컴퓨터 코드를 생성·실행할 수 있을 것\"이라고 예측했다. 컴퓨터 시스템이 인간 통제를 벗어날 수 있다는 의미다. 그는 \"이를 통해 AI가 사람을 조종할 수 있을 것\"이라고 강조했다. 힌튼 교수는 \"AI는 지금까지 인류가 작성한 모든 뉴스, 소설, 기밀 서류 등을 학습했다\"며 \"사람을 조종하고 설득하는 데 매우 능숙할 것\"이라고 덧붙였다.\\n\\n\\n\\n힌튼 교수는 AI가 향후 자의식까지 가질 수 있다고 말했다. (사진=CBS)제프리 힌튼 박사는 AI가 추론 능력을 더 기르면 향후 자의식까지 가질 수 있다고 말했다. AI가 현재 데이터에 기반해 추론하는 것에 그치지만, 향후 자율적인 컴퓨팅 조종으로 자율적인 판단이 가능하다는 이유에서다.힌튼 박사는 향후 AI 추론 능력을 악용하는 사람이나 조직도 늘어날 것이라고 경고했다. 그는 \"해당 추론 능력이 가짜뉴스 생산, 자율 전장 로봇 개발에 활용될 것\"이라고 지적했다. 제프리 힌튼은 \"지금이야말로 각국 정부가 AI를 이해하기 위한 실험을 진행하고, 규제를 도입하고, 군사용 로봇 사용을 금지하는 조약을 체결해야 할 때\"라고 강조했다.물론 그는 높은 AI 추론 능력이 인류에 긍정적 영향도 준다고 덧붙였다. 특히 의료 영상 판독, 약물 설계 분야에 큰 도움을 준다고 했다. 힌튼 박사는 \"AI가 영상의학 분야에서 사람보다 정확한 진단을 할 수 있고, 몇년 걸리는 약물 설계를 단 몇 주로 줄일 수 있기 때문\"이라고 전했다.제프리 힌튼 박사는 AI 분야를 개척한 인지심리학자이자 컴퓨터 과학자다. 오류 역전파법, 딥러닝, 힌튼 다이어그램을 개발했다. 현재 캐나다 토론토대 컴퓨터공학과 교수로 재직 중이다. 올해까지 구글 석학 연구원에서 재직하다 퇴사했다.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n김미정 기자(notyetkim@zdnet.co.kr)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n기자 프로필\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n김미정 기자\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTALK\\n\\n유익하고 소중한 제보를 기다려요!\\n제보\\n\\n닫기\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n구독\\n\\n\\n구독중\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n구독자 0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n응원수\\n0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n매일 새로운 소프트웨어를 취재합니다!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\"사람보다 드론 잘 포착\"…이스라엘군, AI 기술 전쟁 투입\\n\\n\\n구글, 챗봇 바드 이름 제미나이로 바꾼다…유료 앱도 출시\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n지디넷코리아의 구독 많은 기자를 구독해보세요!\\n\\n닫기\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCopyright ⓒ ZDNet Korea.

(사진=CBS)\\n\\n힌튼 교수는 챗봇이 사람보다 매개변수는 적지만, 더 복잡한 일을 사람보다 더 잘 이해, 처리할 수 있다는 입장이다. 그는 \"일반적으로 사람은 복잡한 일을 처리할 경우, 이를 충분히 숙지하고 이해해야 한다\"고 말했다. 사람은 뇌에서 무슨 일이 일어나는지, 신경망이 이를 어떻게 받아들이는지 인지하지 못하기 때문이다.\\n\\n그는 \"반면 AI는 말 그대로 기계\"라며 \"매개변수 간 연결성과 정보 처리 과정을 사람보다 더 잘 안다\"고 설명했다. 힌튼 교수 설명에 따르면, AI가 난이도 높은 업무를 수행할 경우 학습 알고리즘을 통해 데이터와 상호작용하면서 복잡한 신경망을 새로 만든다. 해당 신경망을 통해 복잡한 업무를 즉각적으로 받아들이고 처리할 수 있다.\\n\\n제프리 힌튼 교수는 \"AI의 이런 능력이 더 발달한다면, 향후 자율적으로 컴퓨터 코드를 생성·실행할 수 있을 것\"이라고 예측했다. 컴퓨터 시스템이 인간 통제를 벗어날 수 있다는 의미다. 그는 \"이를 통해 AI가 사람을 조종할 수 있을 것\"이라고 강조했다. 힌튼 교수는 \"AI는 지금까지 인류가 작성한 모든 뉴스, 소설, 기밀 서류 등을 학습했다\"며 \"사람을 조종하고 설득하는 데 매우 능숙할 것\"이라고 덧붙였다.\\n\\n힌튼 교수는 AI가 향후 자의식까지 가질 수 있다고 말했다. (사진=CBS)\\n\\n제프리 힌튼 박사는 AI가 추론 능력을 더 기르면 향후 자의식까지 가질 수 있다고 말했다. AI가 현재 데이터에 기반해 추론하는 것에 그치지만, 향후 자율적인 컴퓨팅 조종으로 자율적인 판단이 가능하다는 이유에서다.\\n\\n힌튼 박사는 향후 AI 추론 능력을 악용하는 사람이나 조직도 늘어날 것이라고 경고했다. 그는 \"해당 추론 능력이 가짜뉴스 생산, 자율 전장 로봇 개발에 활용될 것\"이라고 지적했다. 제프리 힌튼은 \"지금이야말로 각국 정부가 AI를 이해하기 위한 실험을 진행하고, 규제를 도입하고, 군사용 로봇 사용을 금지하는 조약을 체결해야 할 때\"라고 강조했다.\\n\\n물론 그는 높은 AI 추론 능력이 인류에 긍정적 영향도 준다고 덧붙였다. 특히 의료 영상 판독, 약물 설계 분야에 큰 도움을 준다고 했다. 힌튼 박사는 \"AI가 영상의학 분야에서 사람보다 정확한 진단을 할 수 있고, 몇년 걸리는 약물 설계를 단 몇 주로 줄일 수 있기 때문\"이라고 전했다.\\n\\n제프리 힌튼 박사는 AI 분야를 개척한 인지심리학자이자 컴퓨터 과학자다. 오류 역전파법, 딥러닝, 힌튼 다이어그램을 개발했다. 현재 캐나다 토론토대 컴퓨터공학과 교수로 재직 중이다. 올해까지 구글 석학 연구원에서 재직하다 퇴사했다.\\n\\n김미정 기자(notyetkim@zdnet.co.kr)\\n\\n기자 프로필\\n\\n김미정 기자\\n\\nTALK\\n\\n유익하고 소중한 제보를 기다려요!\\n\\n제보\\n\\n구독\\n\\n구독중\\n\\n구독자 0\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t응원수\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t0\\n\\n매일 새로운 소프트웨어를 취재합니다!\\n\\n\"사람보다 드론 잘 포착\"…이스라엘군, AI 기술 전쟁 투입\\n\\n구글, 챗봇 바드 이름 제미나이로 바꾼다…유료 앱도 출시\\n\\n지디넷코리아의 구독 많은 기자를 구독해보세요!\\n\\n닫기\\n\\nCopyright ⓒ ZDNet Korea.

              "'Hello guys, I’m Beijing Royal School 2015 graduate Jason Heesang LEE.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter graduating from Beijing Royal School, I went to Switzerland for the next step studying. Actually, I was preparing to go to United States for university like everyone else did. However I felt that I’m following the trend, not following my dream. So I stopped preparing for United States, but started preparing for Switzerland. Everyone asked me “Why are you going to Switzerland? Let’s go to United States together.” Then I answered, “I found what I want to do, and I want to receive the best education for it.” As Switzerland is known for its hospitality education, it was my decision to go to the best school, Glion Institute of Higher Education.\\n\\n(0)\\n\\n\\n\\nBefore my story starts, I want to say one thing clearly to fellow students in BRS.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Follow your dream, not the trend.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI don’t mean, “Don’t go to United States.”\\n\\nUnited States is a great country, and lots of great universities are in United States.\\n\\nHowever, going to famous, good university only because it is famous and good for your CV is not the best decision.\\n\\nIt would be perfect to go to those schools if it matches your dream.\\n\\nIf it is not, reconsider applying to those schools.\\n\\n\\n\\n- Life in School\\n\\nFirst of all, I will introduce my school little bit.\\n\\n(1)\\n\\nGlion Institute of Higher Education has applied semester-based courses. Unlike any other schools, courses change every semester. And the school has 2 campuses (Glion, Bulle) in Switzerland and 1 campus in London.\\n\\nFirst and second semester students study basic knowledge about hospitality, food & beverage and business with a month of Craft Based Learning / Applied Learning. Courses in the first semester are not very challenging, easy to pass the semester. So during the first semester, it is better to meet more people, and join more activities. I have joined school’s event committee, go green activity, and all kinds of voluntary activities. As the consequences of joining it, I met hundreds of people in all 3 campuses and also the alumnus. Then became dress code model for school and campus life leader for 2016.1. \\n\\n(2)\\n\\n(3)\\n\\n\\n\\nThird and fifth semester are internship semesters. Students can go anywhere in the world for their internship. I’m applying for China, New York, Doha, Dubai, etc.\\n\\n\\n\\nForth, sixth and seventh semester students specialize in their major in Bulle campus.\\n\\n\\n\\n- International, very international it is.\\n\\nThe biggest difference between most of the schools in United States and hospitality schools in Switzerland is the variety of the nationalities of the people in the school. There are more 85 national students in my school, and also the professors, faculties are from all over the world. Since people are from everywhere, students are able to widen their sight, and learn more about many cultures, which is necessary for future hoteliers. \\n\\n(4)\\n\\nMoreover, since most of the students can speak at least three languages, language exchange between the students is quite active. For example, Chinese student teach French students Chinese, French student teach Chinese student French.\\n\\n\\n\\n- Language\\n\\nThere are four main languages in Switzerland: French, German, Italian, and Romance language. Fortunately, even though my school is in French speaking area, classes are taught in English. However, since the location of the school, students have to speak French as soon as they leave the campus. And it is another benefit to study in Switzerland: learning new languages.\\n\\n\\n\\n- Life in Switzerland\\n\\n\\tGlion campus is in Montreux, one of the must visit place in Switzerland. \\n\\n(5)\\n\\n(6)\\n\\n(7)\\n\\nThis city is famous for its view of lake Geneva with Mt.Evian and the fact that this city is the city that Freddy Mercury loved. \\n\\n(8)\\n\\n(9)\\n\\nAnd when it snows, it is so beautiful.\\n\\n (10)\\n\\n\\n\\nThe school offers field trip to the nearby mountains, cities, attractions every weekend. For example, Interlaken, Luzern, Bern(Switzerland), Milano(Italy), Lyon(France), Europa Park (theme park)(Germany), etc. The prices of the trips are much cheaper than if you go there by yourself. Since there is no settled schedule during the trip, students can explore freely.\\n\\nOther than school’s trip, students can also organize to travel around the Europe. For me, I went to Luzern, Engelberg (Switzerland), and Milano last semester. \\n\\n(11)(12)\\n\\nNow I’m already planning to visit London, Rome and Vatican this semester.\\n\\n(13)'"
